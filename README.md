# Countdown Chaos

![Workflow result](https://github.com/RajashekarRaju/android-dev-challenge-compose-two/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description

Android app built with `Jetpack Compose`. This app shows how to manage states between different
screens and make animations with `Compose`.

`Jetpack Compose` is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It enables you to quickly
bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

This app is build for submitting second week #AndroidDevChallenge.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

`Jetpack Compose` will ease the implementing animations faster with less code. Check below previews.
I have made use of `Canvas` and `drawLine drawRoundRect drawCircle` in many places in app also made
infinite transitions using `rememberInfiniteTransition` along `animateFloat animateColor`.

Understanding to implement own `Theme` `Shape` `Typography` `Color` has became bit easier by
referring to lot of official jetpack compose samples which are available in GitHub.

Best of all we got to do this in `Kotlin` way. Excited and long way to go from here.
